Opens a radio podcast page, scans for episodes and their linked-to WCBN playlist pages,
extracts the tracks with their title/artist/album/label/playtime and episode data,
and dumps it all out into a .csv table.

Currently only works with the very specific HTML layout of the DJ Hugonaut podcast,
and the particular HTML layout of the WCBN auto-generated playlist pages.
So it's not very useful if that's not what you're trying to scan.

Perhaps this might be useful as a template if you're trying to do something similar.
